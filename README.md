  üéØ About Challenge
</h3>

In this challenge, I developed an application for help to manage people that playing together in groups. It's an app with stack navigation, is possible register/remove groups ands members of teams and save data in local storage. 
So, features that I need to implement:

- [x] Show list of groups
- [x] Add new group
- [x] Show list of player inside the teams
- [x] Add players and remove then
- [x] Delete group

I need to apply concepts like: 

- Path Mapping
- How to avoid Prop Drilling (I already write an article about props drilling in react/react native at [Medium](https://medium.com/@soutovnc/props-drilling-in-react-react-native-4c0a6f2fe144))
- Navigation with Stack Navigator
- Local Storage with AsyncStorage
- Hooks
- Context and Theme provider

<h3 align="center">
  üíª Tech's & layout
</h3>

I'm basically used this tech's:

- [expo](https://expo.dev/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [AsyncStorage](https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Phosphor](https://www.phosphoricons.com/)

And that was the result achieved

  <img alt="Alert remove group" src="./src/assets/alert-remove-group.png" width="25%" />

## :gear: | If you want to test

### If you can use a emulator, write "a" in terminal to run android emulator
### or use your device and scan the QRcode on terminal
```
See you later, bye üëãüèª!
